/*
Sure! Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the main Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles along with their advantages:

### 1. Encapsulation
- **Definition:** Bundles data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts access to some of the object's components.
- **Advantages:**
  - Protects the internal state of an object.
  - Provides controlled access through public methods (getters/setters).
  - Enhances maintainability and reduces complexity.

### 2. Abstraction
- **Definition:** Hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential features.
- **Advantages:**
  - Simplifies the interface for users.
  - Reduces complexity by focusing on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it.
  - Facilitates easier code management and flexibility.

### 3. Inheritance
- **Definition:** Allows one class (subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (superclass).
- **Advantages:**
  - Promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.
  - Supports method overriding for specific behaviors in subclasses.
  - Establishes a natural hierarchy among classes.

### 4. Polymorphism
- **Definition:** Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, using method overloading and overriding.
- **Advantages:**
  - Enhances flexibility and allows for dynamic method resolution.
  - Facilitates code that can work with objects of different classes through a common interface or superclass.
  - Reduces complexity in code maintenance and enhancement.

These principles together enable developers to create more organized, modular, and reusable code, making software development more efficient and scalable. If you have any more questions or need further clarification on any principle, feel free to ask!
