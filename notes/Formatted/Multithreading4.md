# Chapter 6: Concurrency Challenges & Solutions

## Protecting Critical Sections

We need to protect some areas of our code from concurrent operations so that the operations within them are atomic. This means that only one thread should be allowed in the critical section at a time, ensuring the operations are completed without any interference.

### Example: Critical Section
```java
// Enter critical section
op1();
op2();
op3();
// Exit critical section
```

### How to Guard the Critical Section?

In Java, we can use the `synchronized` keyword as a locking mechanism. It restricts access to a specific piece of code, ensuring that only one thread can execute it at a time.

```java
public synchronized void method1() {
    // critical section code
}
```

### Object-Level Synchronization

The `synchronized` keyword applies at the object level, not just at the method level. Suppose a class has two synchronized methods, and there is an instance of that class. If Thread A is accessing `method1()` via `object1`, no other thread can access even `method2()` of `object1` because all operations on that object are synchronized. This is referred to as a **monitor** in Java, which locks all synchronized methods of the given object.

### Synchronized Block with Lock Object

Another way to use a lock is by synchronizing on an object, like `this`, which gives us more control over the synchronization.

```java
public void method() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // critical section code
    }
}
```

This approach allows you to choose which object to lock on, providing more flexibility.

### Reentrant Locks

In Java, synchronized methods or blocks are reentrant, meaning if Thread A is already in a synchronized method, it can re-enter that method or another synchronized method of the same object. This means that the thread cannot prevent itself from re-entering a critical section.

### Minimizing Critical Sections

Always try to minimize the size of the critical section. The larger the critical section, the less concurrent your program will be, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.

## Atomic Operations, Volatile, & Metrics

### What Are Atomic Operations?

Atomic operations are operations that are completed as a single step. In Java, most reference assignments are atomic (except for `long` and `double`). This means that simple getter and setter methods are atomic as long as they only perform one operation.

```java
Object a = new Object();
Object b = a; // atomic operation
```

Assignments to primitive types (except `long` and `double`) are also atomic. To make `long` and `double` operations atomic, you can use the `volatile` keyword.

```java
volatile double x = 1.0;
```

Java provides the `java.util.concurrent` package for more advanced concurrency needs.

### Metrics Use Case

In production, you might want to measure the duration of certain operations. Metrics can help you track the performance and behavior of your application.

## Race Conditions & Data Races

### Race Condition

A race condition occurs when multiple threads access the same shared resource, and at least one thread modifies that resource. The problem arises because these operations are not atomic, leading to unpredictable results.

#### Example: Race Condition
```java
// Multiple threads accessing a shared resource
sharedResource++;
```

### Data Race

A data race happens when the compiler or CPU executes instructions out of order to optimize performance, while still maintaining logical correctness. This can lead to unexpected behavior in multithreading.

#### Example: Data Race
```java
i++;
j++;
```

In this scenario, `j` could be incremented before `i`, even though `i` appears first in the code. To prevent this, you can declare the variables as `volatile`.

```java
volatile int i = 0;
volatile int j = 0;

i++;
j++;
```

Now, `i` will always be incremented before `j`.

### Rule of Thumb

Either use `synchronized` or `volatile` to manage shared resources properly.

## Locking Strategies & Deadlocks

### Locking Strategies

- **Coarse-Grain Locking:** Using a single lock for everything. This is easy to implement but reduces concurrency.
- **Fine-Grain Locking:** Using multiple locks for different methods. This increases concurrency but can lead to deadlocks.

### Deadlocks

A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources.

#### Example: Deadlock Scenario

- **Resource A** protected by **Lock A**
- **Resource B** protected by **Lock B**

If Thread A locks Resource A and waits for Resource B, while Thread B locks Resource B and waits for Resource A, both threads will be stuck forever. This is a deadlock.

### Conditions for a Deadlock

1. **Mutual Exclusion:** Only one thread can have exclusive access to a resource.
2. **Hold and Wait:** At least one thread is holding a resource and waiting for another.
3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from threads.
4. **Circular Wait:** A chain of threads exists where each thread holds one resource and waits for another.

### Solution to Deadlock

One common solution is to **avoid circular wait** by enforcing a strict order in lock acquisition.

```java
// Always lock in the same order
synchronized(lockA) {
    synchronized(lockB) {
        // critical section code
    }
}
```

There are other strategies like using **WatchDog**, **TryLock Operations**, etc.
