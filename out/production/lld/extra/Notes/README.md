Sure, let's dive deeper into each core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

### **1. Classes and Objects**

**Classes:**
- **Definition:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a type of object based on common attributes and behaviors.
- **Components:**
  - **Fields (Attributes):** Variables that hold the state of an object.
  - **Methods (Behaviors):** Functions that define the behavior of the object.

**Example:**
```java
public class Car {
    // Fields (Attributes)
    String model;
    int year;

    // Method (Behavior)
    void start() {
        System.out.println("The car is starting.");
    }
}
```

**Objects:**
- **Definition:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific realization of the class.
- **Creation:** You create an object using the `new` keyword followed by a constructor of the class.

**Example:**
```java
Car myCar = new Car(); // Create an object of the Car class
myCar.model = "Toyota";
myCar.year = 2022;
myCar.start(); // Call the method
```

### **2. Encapsulation**

**Definition:**
- **Encapsulation** is the principle of wrapping the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent unintended interference and misuse of the data.

**Implementation:**
- **Access Modifiers:** Control the visibility of class members.
  - `private`: Accessible only within the class.
  - `protected`: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
  - `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
  - **Default (Package-Private):** Accessible only within the same package.

**Example:**
```java
public class Person {
    private String name; // Private field
    private int age;     // Private field

    // Public getter method
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Public setter method
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

### **3. Inheritance**

**Definition:**
- **Inheritance** allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called a **subclass** or **derived class**, and the class being inherited from is called a **superclass** or **base class**.

**Types:**
- **Single Inheritance:** A class inherits from one superclass.
- **Multiple Inheritance:** A class inherits from more than one superclass (Java supports this through interfaces).

**Example:**
```java
// Base Class
public class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Derived Class
public class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```

### **4. Polymorphism**

**Definition:**
- **Polymorphism** means "many shapes." It allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It provides a way to perform the same action in different ways.

**Types:**
- **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):** Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.
- **Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding):** Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

**Examples:**

**Method Overloading:**
```java
public class Printer {
    void print(int i) {
        System.out.println("Printing integer: " + i);
    }

    void print(String s) {
        System.out.println("Printing string: " + s);
    }
}
```

**Method Overriding:**
```java
public class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }
}
```

### **5. Abstraction**

**Definition:**
- **Abstraction** is the principle of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing complexity and allows focusing on interactions at a higher level.

**Types:**
- **Abstract Classes:** Can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
- **Interfaces:** Define a contract for what a class can do, without specifying how.

**Examples:**

**Abstract Class:**
```java
public abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method

    void color() { // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Coloring the shape.");
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}
```

**Interface:**
```java
public interface Drawable {
    void draw(); // Abstract method
}

public class Triangle implements Drawable {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a triangle.");
    }
}
```
